This plugin allows you to create a simple responsive slider that displays the featured image, along with the title and excerpt from each post.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create a simple responsive slider that displays the featured image, along with the title and excerpt from each post.

It includes options for the maximum dimensions of your slideshow, allows you to choose to display posts or pages, what category to pull from, and even the specific post IDs of the posts you want to display. It includes next/previous arrows and a pager along with the option to turn both on or off. Finally, you can place the slider into a widget area.

The slideshow is also responsive and will automatically adjust for the screen it is being displayed on.

Note: This plugin only supports Genesis child themes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `genesis-responsive-slider` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. DO NOT change the name of the `genesis-responsive-slider` folder

1. Navigate to the `Genesis > Slider Settings` menu

== Child Theme Integration ==

`add_filter( 'genesis_responsive_slider_settings_defaults', 'my_child_theme_responsive_slider_defaults' );

function my_child_theme_responsive_slider_defaults( $defaults ) {
	$defaults = array(
